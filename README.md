### How to run the project? ‚úÖ

To run this project, you need the following:

* A machine running a recent version of macOS
* [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* The [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile)

### Check your environment

Before you start, use the [KDoctor](https://github.com/Kotlin/kdoctor) tool to ensure that your development environment is configured correctly:

1. Install KDoctor with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): ``brew install kdoctor``

2. Run KDoctor in your terminal: ``kdoctor``

   If everything is set up correctly, you'll see valid output:

   ```text
   Environment diagnose (to see all details, use -v option):
   [‚úì] Operation System
   [‚úì] Java
   [‚úì] Android Studio
   [‚úì] Xcode
   [‚úì] Cocoapods
   
   Conclusion:
     ‚úì Your system is ready for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile development!
   ```

Otherwise, KDoctor will highlight which parts of your setup still need to be configured and will suggest a way to fix them.

## Understanding the project structure

Open the project in Android Studio and switch the view from **Android** to **Project** to see all the files and targets belonging to the project:

Your Compose Multiplatform project includes 3 modules:

### shared

This is a Kotlin module that contains the logic common for both Android and iOS applications, that is, the code you share between platforms.

This `shared` module is also where you‚Äôll write your Compose Multiplatform code.
In `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/App.kt`, you can find the shared root `@Composable` function for your app.

It uses Gradle as the build system. You can add dependencies and change settings in `shared/build.gradle.kts`.
The `shared` module builds into an Android library and an iOS framework.

### androidApp

This is a Kotlin module that builds into an Android application. It uses Gradle as the build system.
The `androidApp` module depends on and uses the `shared` module as a regular Android library.

### iosApp

This is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application.
It depends on and uses the `shared` module as a CocoaPods dependency.

## Run your application

### On Android

To run your application on an Android emulator:

1. Ensure you have an Android virtual device available. Otherwise, [create one](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd).
2. In the list of run configurations, select `androidApp`.
3. Choose your virtual device and click **Run**

### On iOS

#### Running on a simulator

To run your application on an iOS simulator in Android Studio, modify the `iosApp` run configuration:

1. In the list of run configurations, select **Edit Configurations**
2. Navigate to **iOS Application** | **iosApp**.
3. In the **Execution target** list, select your target device. Click **OK**.
4. The `iosApp` run configuration is now available. Click **Run** next to your virtual device.

<summary>How to create and run a simple project in Xcode</summary>

1. On the Xcode welcome screen, select **Create a new project in Xcode**.
2. On the **iOS** tab, choose the **App** template. Click **Next**.
3. Specify the product name and keep other settings default. Click **Next**.
4. Select where to store the project on your computer and click **Create**. You'll see an app that displays "Hello, world!" on the device screen.
5. At the top of your Xcode screen, click on the device name near the **Run** button.
6. Plug your device into the computer. You'll see this device in the list of run options.
7. Choose your device and click **Run**.
